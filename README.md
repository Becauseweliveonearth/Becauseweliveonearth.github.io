He grabbed the upper roof of the bus, 'Ojota', 'Ojota', '100 naira', the bus was moving on as he barely stepped his feet on the ground. 'Kpa', 'Kpa', 'Kpa', the conductor banged the side of the front door. The bus kept moving, another person shouted. 'Shori' pe won fe sole ni. (Can't you see they want to come down). 'Oya', the bus finally came to a stop. 

It was in the middle of the 'car park', well "Let's stretch ur legs shall we". The cool breeze blew across the earth, the hustle and bustle in the background, the sound of life. Nice, the women selling 'Agbo', the men making jest, low music playing fuji from under the bench 5m away. What a great day. 

'Oga, look road o', a bumbling young man said, He looked at him, the staggering man stood straight yet persisted, 'Wetin you dey find here', He lowered his eyes as he smiled, fear, dread and darkness gripped the agbero, he stood straighter and instinctively stepped aside so He could pass.

Walking the roads, to take the back streets or not, today was an expressway kinda day. The walking continued. Fruit vendors, akara sellers, corn sellers, medicine men with megaphone, book sellers on the railway. It's been a while. 

Eventually, He was getting hungry, guess wasn't keeping track of the walk. Almost there, alas some construction on the way. "Giant of where" little chuckle. No way to walk across this physically without breaking the law. well might as well grab something to eat in Adealu street as a detour around it.

Where to get money, no fishes to catch money from, the giving people live too far, 'We move', the atmosphere programming was taking effect. Need o hurry up. 

Iya Amebo, 'shay, akara never done', 'No, o', 'Yam done ready, shey you go take am', 'May I wait'. 'Okay, na small remain, after this one'. Short of snapping fingers, how to buy buns. "Make her laugh, ask someone? Where was the nearest christian?" 'Too far, too uninterested"

Okay, 'ah mummy Amaka', shey na you be that. 'Aah Teacher Tunde', I no know sey you dey pass this side, no I just dey waka somewhere today. Wetin you wan buy, 'Give me buns 200#', Okay, here take, 'May I add puff puff'. 'Thank you'. 'No bring money o, this one na thank you, all your work for Amaka. 'Aaah Thank you mummy Amaka'. 'We thank God'

The Rabbi dusted off his hat, truly we thank God. 

Wow, who was in charge of buns in the heavens, somebody's recipe needs updating.

As the sweet taste of hot buns settled in, a man walking unawares bumped into him as he turned the corner on the street. "Aah Olugbala" as he bowed, Gbenga wore a white garment, was barefooted coming from church. Both stood still eventually He walked away. Gbenga stood there wondering, what had happened and why 'Olugbala.'

Almost back to the expressway, the adventures of today were.... Suddenly, he observed a child drifting in and out of sleep, hungry. Anger stirred, 'hmh', nearby was a woman selling bread. 

He reached out and touched the man coming towards him who has just bought a loaf of bread, the man kept walking and then saw the child. 'Gba' (Take) He said, 'Shoti jeun leni', 'Gba', 'ese', came the faint reply. 'A dupe fun olorun'

Truly we thank God.

The smell of smoked fish, and children singing nigh songs rose through the air. The walk was coming to an end.

This was the house, he went in and saw her, she had slept off, were those dried tears, NSPDD playing on the phone nex to her. He sat on her bed, "Every gaze is on the lion and the lamb."

"The LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his love; he will exult over you with loud singing." Zephaniah 3:17
