## The minimum work to get started
>>Not sure how this got started but I was thing about when God made earth, he starte with the minimum, the earth, the man , the animals and systems to guie the man and God said, okay run on autopilot till you fully create the earth. The bible says no one knows what God is doing. But the world has vastly changed and has been changed by man since God left it all thoe many years ago and man has continued to develop it, maninting it for themselves to live and creating all sorts of thing with all sorts of things, orchestras, music, machines, complex knowledge. God created the minimum to get man going and man is creating like God would have created, sometimes individually, othertimes not.
The first time I use amplified because it is just so beautiful, <p style="text-align: center;">He has also planted eternity [a sense of divine purpose] in the human heart [a mysterious longing which nothing under the sun can satisfy, except God]—yet man cannot find out (comprehend, grasp) what God has done (His overall plan) from the beginning to the end.</p>

>> So I think o what it takes to get a project off the ground, to run on autopilot, obviously God checked in on Adam often and so is ever present. But like the original creator, we can learn a thing or two about what it takes to get a project started

><h2 style="text-align: center;"> In the beginning </h2>
1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.[a] 2 The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.

3 Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light “day” and the darkness “night.”

And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day.

6 Then God said, “Let there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth.” 7 And that is what happened. God made this space to separate the waters of the earth from the waters of the heavens. 8 God called the space “sky.”

And evening passed and morning came, marking the second day.

9 Then God said, “Let the waters beneath the sky flow together into one place, so dry ground may appear.” And that is what happened. 10 God called the dry ground “land” and the waters “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 11 Then God said, “Let the land sprout with vegetation—every sort of seed-bearing plant, and trees that grow seed-bearing fruit. These seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came.” And that is what happened. 12 The land produced vegetation—all sorts of seed-bearing plants, and trees with seed-bearing fruit. Their seeds produced plants and trees of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.

13 And evening passed and morning came, marking the third day.

14 Then God said, “Let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, days, and years. 15 Let these lights in the sky shine down on the earth.” And that is what happened. 16 God made two great lights—the larger one to govern the day, and the smaller one to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17 God set these lights in the sky to light the earth, 18 to govern the day and night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.

19 And evening passed and morning came, marking the fourth day.

20 Then God said, “Let the waters swarm with fish and other life. Let the skies be filled with birds of every kind.” 21 So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that scurries and swarms in the water, and every sort of bird—each producing offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 Then God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply. Let the fish fill the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”

23 And evening passed and morning came, marking the fifth day.

24 Then God said, “Let the earth produce every sort of animal, each producing offspring of the same kind—livestock, small animals that scurry along the ground, and wild animals.” And that is what happened. 25 God made all sorts of wild animals, livestock, and small animals, each able to produce offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.

26 Then God said, “Let us make human beings[b] in our image, to be like us. They will reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on the earth,[c] and the small animals that scurry along the ground.”

27 So God created human beings[d] in his own image.
    In the image of God he created them;
    male and female he created them.

28 Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground.”

29 Then God said, “Look! I have given you every seed-bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food. 30 And I have given every green plant as food for all the wild animals, the birds in the sky, and the small animals that scurry along the ground—everything that has life.” And that is what happened.

31 Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was very good!

And evening passed and morning came, marking the sixth day.

## The three Daniels
>>So I know three daniels, really this story should end here but because the story starts of great let's continue. These three daniels are their own persons and I am trying not to tie them to what they are to me, because I have a LOT I can say about that but they are their own persons. Are there any similarities between the three daniels, they are all chritians, they are all humans, they are all men. 

>>I have nothing else to say. I know three daniels.


## Employers
<p style="text-align: center;">For the LORD is God, and he created the heavens and earth and put everything in place. He made the world to be lived in, not to be a place of empty chaos.Isiah 45:18 NLT</p>
Today I observe that everyone has a role to play in this world and eventually while some people end up as employers and others as employees. The bible implores us to take this positions as roles and not lord the over people, oppressing them or taking advantage of them. If you are responsible for if your employee is constantly worried about if they have food on their table then you are oppressive. If there is enough money in the system but some people are hoarding it and everyone is walking about stressed and they call on God then an evil thing has happened. 

In summary, God wants everyone on earth to live good lives regardless of what they do and my prayer is that we all recognize our roles in our community and rather than lord it over others, see it as a service to God, a responsibility from God, a palace administrator of some sorts on earth temporarily in charge and let God use us to fufill his vision on earth.


>>1Look here, you rich people: Weep and groan with anguish because of all the terrible troubles ahead of you. 2Your wealth is rotting away, and your fine clothes are moth-eaten rags. 3Your gold and silver are corroded. The very wealth you were counting on will eat away your flesh like fire. This corroded treasure you have hoarded will testify against you on the day of judgment. 4For listen! Hear the cries of the field workers whom you have cheated of their pay. The cries of those who harvest your fields have reached the ears of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies.
5You have spent your years on earth in luxury, satisfying your every desire. You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter. 6You have condemned and killed innocent people, who do not resist you. James 5:4

## What is inside a man
>>The world around us is usually, what is inside a man. The environment reflects the imaginations of a man. The outside reflects the inside. Everything yousee was in th heart of a man before it came out. The cups, the charts, it was all the thoughts of someones heart. Who can stir a man's heart towards good things, who can stir a mans heart except the Lord. Yet there are captains, men of God who can stir the hearts of men to its natural direction. 

Now I am looking at all the things in my room and how far they must have traveed to get to me. How much time was taken from idea to inception, 1 year, two days, twenty years. As we thank the farmer fr food by God, we should thank the printers for the books and everyone else as they released the gifts given to them by God. 

Though good advice lies deep within the heart, a person with understanding will draw it out. Prov. 20:5 NLT 



## And David trusted in God
<p style="text-align: center;">For You will not leave my soul in Sheol, Nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.Psalm 16:10 NLT</p>

I imagine King David on his bed, imagining things beynd him. Did King David know what he was saying, that there will be a messiah, that Jesus will come. Was it a faint knowing. But today as I go through some uncertainties I remember that David trusted in God and many years later after david was long gone and buried God sent Jesus who came and won ressurection power for all who were held captive by death.

We didn't invent this world and we don't get to dictate the rules of this world, and while we might understand some things in the world, they seem all so strange to us as pilgrims. But the only person that is outside all of this is God and why we need t hear the voice of God as like the coach outisde the game who we can trust with a 360 perspective.

><h2 style="text-align: center;">Sometimes all you need is that if God answered David's prayer long after David was gone, if David trusted God I should trust God.</h2>


## For the glory of God/God at work
>>So I have decide to observe sabbath, at least on this website and skip one day of the week. So on this Monday, we will talk aout giving God the glory. Really it means giving God the credit. 
Many times things happen on earth and we don't know how it happened or who to thank. You meeting that person, you applying to that school. All the invisible workings of God, giving God the glory is simply signing the work with God's name and singing his praises concerning it. 
What about doing things for the glory of God. For some reason best known to God, the bible states that God has chosen us to participate in his glory. Although we cannot contain the weight of his glory, we can redirect it to God. Hence doing things for the glory of God implies a discovery of the glory of God. It means a revelation of God in that situation. Also in denying ourselves glory in that situation and giving the coming glory to God we simply walk in the correct order things are meant to be in.

><h2 style="text-align: center;"> The awe of God </h2>
14 “I will ransom them from the power of the grave;
I will redeem them from death.
O Death, I will be your plagues!
O Grave, I will be your destruction!
Pity is hidden from My eyes.” Hosea 13:14

## Peace is alignment
>>To live in peace is to live in alignment with God. God loves peace. In the presence of God it's peaceful, inside and out. The meaning of solomon is peace and God gave him peace during his time -  only peacemakers appparently can build the house for God. 

<p style="text-align: center;">Turn away from evil and do good. Search for peace, and work to maintain it.Psalm 34:14 NLT</p>

>>Apparently peace is made, you can make peace. Your peace is not dependent on the other person, you can engender peace. You can seek peace as well. Peace can be sought, made and maintained through you.

<p style="text-align: center;">My soul has dwelt too long
With one who hates peace.
7 I am for peace;
But when I speak, they are for war. Psalm 120:6-7</p>

>>Be careful though sometimes, a lack of peace for a long time can affect your soul, and even when you want peace you have no motivations to it. You become simply content with letting sleeping dogs lie rather than addressing it.

><p style="text-align: center;"> So those who are smart keep their mouths shut,
    for it is an evil time. Amos5:13 </p>
><p style="text-align: center;">But I say, do not resist an evil person! Matt 5:39 </p>
><p style="text-align: center;">Make sure that the light you think you have is not actually darkness.Luke 11:35</p>    

>>How do we make sure we are walking this path with fear and trembling - not subjecting our souls to war but yet making sure we are factories of peace, making it happily. As the popular hymn says take it to God in prayer, Oh what peace we often forfeit, oh what needless pain we bear. (What a friend we have in Jesus, All our sins and griefs to bear, 1885)

><p style="text-align: center;"><ins>Alignment </ins> </p>  

But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side, and there is no adversary or disaster. 5 I intend, therefore, to build a temple for the Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord told my father David, when he said, ‘Your son whom I will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my Name.’ 1 Kings 5:4-5

><h2 style="text-align: center;"> The state to be found in which has rewards </h2>
“God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him,  
    for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.  
God blesses those who mourn,  
    for they will be comforted.  
God blesses those who are humble,  
    for they will inherit the whole earth.  
God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice,  
    for they will be satisfied.  
God blesses those who are merciful,  
    for they will be shown mercy.  
God blesses those whose hearts are pure,  
    for they will see God.  
God blesses those who work for peace,  
    for they will be called the children of God.  
God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right,  
    for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.  

## Cream Cheese and working for it
>>As i reached for the very fancy cream cheese, organic and all(It was actually cottage cheese), I thought of how expensive it was. As I got home I recieved an email, assigning me work. My mind immediately got a correlation between fancy cream cheese and work, as though if you want fancy cream cheese be willing to workk for it. So thoughts, on woking for a particular lifestyle?
><p style="text-align: center;">Second, give me neither poverty nor riches!
    Give me just enough to satisfy my needs.
9 For if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?”
    And if I am too poor, I may steal and thus insult God’s holy name. Prov 30:8-9 NLT</p>

>>I like to think whether rich or poor, God gives each person just enough to satisfy their needs or expects them to take just enough to satisfy their needs. So the key is to be sober, learn not to live for the thrill of life, but also learn not to live below life. Why want to live forever if you don't enjoy life. The christian life is about living the same type of life in all circumstances. In abundance and abasement, which Apostle Paul learnt.
>>So concerning this cream cheese (cottage cheese) situation, I actually want to return it, its pretty obvious that I would rather not work than have cream cheese. But my life has become God's life and if God wants to grade almost 100 scripts through me. I will make a great cup of coffee, put my leg up and give God a go at it.
>>So my philosophy of work and the reward of it is currently similar to the five solas - soli Deo gloria (to the glory of God). sola gratia (by grace alone),sola fide (faith alone), solus Christus (through Christ alone) and sola scriptura (because it is ordained in the scripts for me). 

><p style="text-align: center;"> I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little. Phil 4:12</p>

I want a message that I can bring   
Not fear of man, it's fear of God   
Take me into battle, I want my sword   
That's right   
My lust for life, get rid of it

## The one who leaves vs The one who stays 

>>Recently I got into some popular celebrity lives and as the peacemaker that I am. I can say I get both sides. One side believes in accepting how you were born and living out the live ordained for you. The other believes the greater cause is to lead the people to new land, to greener pastures. I have admit, I relate more to the idea of leaving than staying but God has been teaching me recently the importance of accepting your divine destiny.

><p style="text-align: center;"> ”When it was Esther’s turn to go to the king, she accepted the advice of Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the harem. She asked for nothing except what he suggested, and she was admired by everyone who saw her.“ Esther‬ ‭2‬:‭15‬ ‭NLT‬‬ </p>

><p style="text-align: center;">He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. Psalm 47:4</p>

>>Even in the patriarchs you have all three scenarios illustrated. Abraham who left his father’s house and traditions to form a new people who will be bound under the convent to his family. A nation as vast as the stars.
>>Isaac who God told not to live where he was born and Jacob. In all these scenarios, as long as it was done in faith it pleased God. Whether to accept the traditions you have been given to carry, to diverge from what you have always known or to return to the traditions after running away. Accepting destiny can reveal itself in any number of ways.
>>And so to this present day family - I feel very strongly about the side that believes in a place in life, a given station in life, it’s probably less stressful to believe that. Yet I have always remembered Jacob who kept trying to hack his way to what he wanted - even though it was always apportioned to him, but that is another story. The other side believes in making a new way, a new path by faith. Yet even Jacob after wrestling with God had to come to the place of acceptance.
>>Faith determines the correct path. The side God is on determines the correct path. 
The centrist in me, both sides are correct. After a long period of having a hard stance on everything, peace seems inconclusive, yet it gives space for God. Also "Feelings of compassion befit a pilgrim" (Pilgrim's progress, page 238). In any fight, both sides are hurting hard, this is the time to sympathize.

><p style="text-align: center;"><ins> God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob</ins></p>

”The Lord had said to Abram, “Leave your native country, your relatives, and your father’s family, and go to the land that I will show you.“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭12‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬

”The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt, but do as I tell you. Live here as a foreigner in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. I hereby confirm that I will give all these lands to you and your descendants, just as I solemnly promised Abraham, your father. He reopened the wells his father had dug, which the Philistines had filled in after Abraham’s death. Isaac also restored the names Abraham had given them.“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭26‬:‭2‬-‭3‬, ‭18‬ ‭NLT‬‬

God to Jacob”What’s more, I am with you, and I will protect you wherever you go. One day I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have finished giving you everything I have promised you.”“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭28‬:‭15‬ ‭NLT‬‬

”I will go with you down to Egypt, and I will bring you back again. You will die in Egypt, but Joseph will be with you to close your eyes.”“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭46‬:‭4‬ ‭NLT‬‬

## Mercy vs Judgement
><p style="text-align: center;">There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others. But if you have been merciful, God will be merciful when he judges you. James 2:13.</p>

><p style="text-align: center;">Then he added, “Now go and learn the meaning of this Scripture: ‘I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.’ For I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners.” Mathew 9:13.</p>

<br>


>>On today's episode of lifing, I am learning not to take things too seriously, imagine you are in a video game and you as a character gets angry over who spilled water on the floor or something trivial. From the players perspective, its all trivial and so today I realized all quarrels must seem trivial to God on some level.

>>On another level, the key to showing mercy is in how you judge yourself. You should judge yourself as someone who is living just by the mercies of God, having recieved mercy.

>>Sometimes it can be hard in areas where you excel and easier in areas where you are weak. Yet we have to believe the bible when God says we are all sinners. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.


<br>
 ><p style="text-align: center;"> <ins>The Parable of the unforgiving servant.</ins></p>

21 Then Peter came to him and asked, “Lord, how often should I forgive someone[i] who sins against me? Seven times?”<br>

22 “No, not seven times,” Jesus replied, “but seventy times seven![j]<br>

23 “Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him. 24 In the process, one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars.[k] 25 He couldn’t pay, so his master ordered that he be sold—along with his wife, his children, and everything he owned—to pay the debt.<br>

26 “But the man fell down before his master and begged him, ‘Please, be patient with me, and I will pay it all.’ 27 Then his master was filled with pity for him, and he released him and forgave his debt.<br>

28 “But when the man left the king, he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars.[l] He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment.<br>

29 “His fellow servant fell down before him and begged for a little more time. ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it,’ he pleaded. 30 But his creditor wouldn’t wait. He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.<br>

31 “When some of the other servants saw this, they were very upset. They went to the king and told him everything that had happened. 32 Then the king called in the man he had forgiven and said, ‘You evil servant! I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me. 33 Shouldn’t you have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?’ 34 Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt.<br>

35 “That’s what my heavenly Father will do to you if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters[m] from your heart.”.
