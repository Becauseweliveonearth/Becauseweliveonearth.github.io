## Cream Cheese and working for it
>>As i reached for the very ancy cream cheese, organic and all(It was actually cottage cheese), I thought of how expensive it was. As I got home I recieved an email, assigning me work. My mind immediately got a correlation between fancy cream cheese and work, as though if you want fancy cream cheese be willing to workk for it. So thoughts, on woking for a particular lifestyle?
><p style="text-align: center;">Second, give me neither poverty nor riches!
    Give me just enough to satisfy my needs.
9 For if I grow rich, I may deny you and say, “Who is the Lord?”
    And if I am too poor, I may steal and thus insult God’s holy name. Prov 30:8-9 NLT</p>

| I'm just a man, a rescued heart
Pull me in the future, set me apart
My destiny is at the door
Lord, I wanna follow Your will for more
My lust for life, get rid of it
My heart is rest-assured
I'd never live for the thrill of it
On and on and on I'd search
My God, His plan, He's running it
My fear has found its cure
Your love, now my deliverance, ooh
Now it's 1:11
A beginning, it's the start of accepting the call
It's a new endeavor
He breathed into my life, now everything aligns
Give me an anthem I can sing
I want a message that I can bring
Not fear of man, it's fear of God
Take me into battle, I want my sword
That's right
My lust for life, get rid of it
My heart is rest-assured
I'd never live for the thrill of it
On and on and on I'd search
My God, His plan, He's running it
My fear has found its cure
Your love, now my deliverance, ooh
Now it's 1:11
A beginning, it's the start of accepting the call
It's a new endeavor
He breathed into my life, now everything aligns
Now it's 1:11
Jesus didn't die for me to wonder why
Why I am living
Everything aligns, everything aligns
Breathe into my lungs, open up my eyes
Give me what I need to live out this life
I'm asking for more, I'm ending this war
Complacency kills; I'll follow You, Lord
Breathe into my lungs, open up my eyes
Give me what I need to live out this life
I'm asking for more, I'm ending this war
Complacency kills; I'll follow You, Lord
Breathe into my lungs, open up my eyes
Give me what I need to live out this life
I'm asking for more, I'm ending this war
Complacency kills; I'll follow You, Lord
Breathe into my lungs, open up my eyes
Give me what I need to live out this life
I'm asking for more, I'm ending this war
Complacency kills; I'll follow You, Lord
Everything aligns, aligns, aligns
Everything aligns, aligns, aligns
Everything aligns, aligns, aligns
Everything aligns, aligns, aligns
Everything
Everything aligns
Life's not mine
Jesus paid it all  | Content Cell  |

## The one who leaves vs The one who stays 

>>Recently I got into some popular celebrity lives and as the peacemaker that I am. I can say I get both sides. One side believes in accepting how you were born and living out the live ordained for you. The other believes the greater cause is to lead the people to new land, to greener pastures. I have admit, I relate more to the idea of leaving than staying but God has been teaching me recently the importance of accepting your divine destiny.

><p style="text-align: center;"> ”When it was Esther’s turn to go to the king, she accepted the advice of Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the harem. She asked for nothing except what he suggested, and she was admired by everyone who saw her.“ Esther‬ ‭2‬:‭15‬ ‭NLT‬‬ </p>

><p style="text-align: center;">He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. Psalm 47:4</p>

>>Even in the patriarchs you have all three scenarios illustrated. Abraham who left his father’s house and traditions to form a new people who will be bound under the convent to his family. A nation as vast as the stars.
>>Isaac who God told not to live where he was born and Jacob. In all these scenarios, as long as it was done in faith it pleased God. Whether to accept the traditions you have been given to carry, to diverge from what you have always known or to return to the traditions after running away. Accepting destiny can reveal itself in any number of ways.
>>And so to this present day family - I feel very strongly about the side that believes in a place in life, a given station in life, it’s probably less stressful to believe that. Yet I have always remembered Jacob who kept trying to hack his way to what he wanted - even though it was always apportioned to him, but that is another story. The other side believes in making a new way, a new path by faith. Yet even Jacob after wrestling with God had to come to the place of acceptance.
>>Faith determines the correct path. The side God is on determines the correct path. 
The centrist in me, both sides are correct. After a long period of having a hard stance on everything, peace seems inconclusive, yet it gives space for God. Also "Feelings of compassion befit a pilgrim" (Pilgrim's progress, page 238). In any fight, both sides are hurting hard, this is the time to sympathize.

><p style="text-align: center;"><ins> God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob</ins></p>

”The Lord had said to Abram, “Leave your native country, your relatives, and your father’s family, and go to the land that I will show you.“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭12‬:‭1‬ ‭NLT‬‬

”The Lord appeared to Isaac and said, “Do not go down to Egypt, but do as I tell you. Live here as a foreigner in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. I hereby confirm that I will give all these lands to you and your descendants, just as I solemnly promised Abraham, your father. He reopened the wells his father had dug, which the Philistines had filled in after Abraham’s death. Isaac also restored the names Abraham had given them.“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭26‬:‭2‬-‭3‬, ‭18‬ ‭NLT‬‬

God to Jacob”What’s more, I am with you, and I will protect you wherever you go. One day I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have finished giving you everything I have promised you.”“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭28‬:‭15‬ ‭NLT‬‬

”I will go with you down to Egypt, and I will bring you back again. You will die in Egypt, but Joseph will be with you to close your eyes.”“
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭46‬:‭4‬ ‭NLT‬‬

## Mercy vs Judgement
><p style="text-align: center;">There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others. But if you have been merciful, God will be merciful when he judges you. James 2:13.</p>

><p style="text-align: center;">Then he added, “Now go and learn the meaning of this Scripture: ‘I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.’ For I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners.” Mathew 9:13.</p>

<br>


>>On today's episode of lifing, I am learning not to take things too seriously, imagine you are in a video game and you as a character gets angry over who spilled water on the floor or something trivial. From the players perspective, its all trivial and so today I realized all quarrels must seem trivial to God on some level.

>>On another level, the key to showing mercy is in how you judge yourself. You should judge yourself as someone who is living just by the mercies of God, having recieved mercy.

>>Sometimes it can be hard in areas where you excel and easier in areas where you are weak. Yet we have to believe the bible when God says we are all sinners. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

 ><p style="text-align: center;"> <ins>The Parable of the unforgiving servant.</ins></p>

21 Then Peter came to him and asked, “Lord, how often should I forgive someone[i] who sins against me? Seven times?”<br>

22 “No, not seven times,” Jesus replied, “but seventy times seven![j]<br>

23 “Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him. 24 In the process, one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars.[k] 25 He couldn’t pay, so his master ordered that he be sold—along with his wife, his children, and everything he owned—to pay the debt.<br>

26 “But the man fell down before his master and begged him, ‘Please, be patient with me, and I will pay it all.’ 27 Then his master was filled with pity for him, and he released him and forgave his debt.<br>

28 “But when the man left the king, he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars.[l] He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment.<br>

29 “His fellow servant fell down before him and begged for a little more time. ‘Be patient with me, and I will pay it,’ he pleaded. 30 But his creditor wouldn’t wait. He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.<br>

31 “When some of the other servants saw this, they were very upset. They went to the king and told him everything that had happened. 32 Then the king called in the man he had forgiven and said, ‘You evil servant! I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me. 33 Shouldn’t you have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?’ 34 Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt.<br>

35 “That’s what my heavenly Father will do to you if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters[m] from your heart.”.
