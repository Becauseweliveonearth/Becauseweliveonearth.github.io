Writer oh writer
You saw this heart from the beginning
But still you put this story in your heart
Even though it was ugly and disjointed
You called it the best kind
You called me the best kind
So i'll sing
Hallelujah to the writer who came and made me new
Hallelujah to the writer who came and made me new
Thank you
So put me on your books now
And write me out write me out
Place me in your editor now
Until you see the story through me
And I'm ready to come out
And all that was wrong
It won't be wrong after this no
Not after this
And all those cliffhangers
Is finding life again
And a true friend that so happens to be a writer
Ohhhhh
Hallelujah to the writer who came and made me new
Hallelujah to the writer who came and made me new
Thank you
Cause you take broken stories
And make them beautiful
Oh you take broken stories
And make them beautiful again
Oh broken tales
And make them beautiful
Oh you take wrong tales and put the truth back in them again
Cause you take broken tales
And make them beautiful
Oh you take the wrong fables
And make them tell the truth again
Oh broken tapes
And make them whole in your eternal story again
And somehow they fit in your eternal story again
Oh you take wrong tales and put the truth back in them again
Cause you take missing characters
And put them back in the story again
Oh you take silent characters
And make the storyline theirs again
Oh scrawny lines, hiding characters
And make them truthfully beautiful again
Oh you take tales going nowhere and put them back together again
So i'll say
Hallelujah to the writer who came and made me new
Hallelujah to the writer who came and made me new
I look just like you
So come and go with me
To the writers house, in his own story, where we as characters will actually come alive for the first time
And you best believe
Oh he'll something good
Oh he'll make something good
Yeah he'll make something good
Oh he'll make something good off some words
 on the paper
