Maybe not specifically immigrant, maybe you grew up in somewhere else and suddenly found yourself in the gift giving traditions of America.

Here are some "immigrant"/"immigrant-adjacent" great gifts for Christmas.

1. ASK THEM
Usually cash is king and a lot of people will appreciate cash especially if it is a large sum. So before making that big purchase ask them what they have been saving up for in a while. It always feels good, to really want something and eventually not have to spend your money to get it.

Note: There will be no specific brand naming, just a grouping of similar items per suggestions. Feel free to get a derivative or something similar, r more to the persons taste.

2. SENTIMENTAL TRINKETS: Car bumpers, Key chains, freezer magnets, school sweatshirts. Consider the person you are giving the gift, do they like books? Consider getting them a sentmental book rnament, or your school sweatshirt if this something they will appreciate or a berkely mom lience place for your mom.

3. FOOD: Cerain foods frm the abroad, are hard to get in Ameria cnnsider spending some money and getting some local fruits from home or something they have not had in a while. For Nigerians consider things like Ofada rice, yams, if you are spending time with them you could even consider finishing the job and cooking it if its a cookable fod. Yum!

4. CLOTHES: Everyone appreciates a good piee of clothing that fits well. That's the key, it has to fit well. onsider colors that are nt flashy except you are sure that is what they like. A tip is to look at what they already wn and buy smething similar, though people like getting ifts they usually would not buy with their money. Consider everyday items like, sweaters, excercie clothes as safe bets, to be exploratory - fancey scarves, or other cloth items.

5. GAMES and books: This is quite an odd one but a good choice for a couple starting out, a student starting out in ollege, a student starting a job etc. or a place you regularly hangout. Contribute to the pot.

6. SELF CARE ITEMS: Who doesn't love a good luxury travel kit, or bath bomb or mask or scented santzer or handwash, I could go on. Avid makeup items except you are a makeup artist, peoples preferences are vastly different.

7.ACCESSORIES: Who doesn't appreciate a good bucket hat, fanny pack, cute packsack, earring, money purse, socks, jewelry, bracelets, sunglasses, wristwatch, necklace all f these, especially if customizable make great gifts.

Have a Merry and loved Christmas!!!
