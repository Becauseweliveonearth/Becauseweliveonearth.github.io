'Eya ya, eya ya eya ya ehhhh'

We have all heard the atmosphere change as the songs dropped.

The first origins of the song was from Lawence Oyr who popularized, ah,ah ah ah. 

However, we trace it o an earlier surce, Pasor Chris Delvan, appaently he fire for revival is from the ashes of the past.

Pastor Chris Delvan apparenly asked God what were the songs of the spirit an  the holy spirit. Ephesians 5:19 and God revealed it to him.

However, it seems these songs have an even more ancient origin an are called Nigguns by he Jewish people and hey do what hey do change the atmospehere to bring about a spritual conciousness and they ae a lot of them, even hough I know all Nigerians know at least two.

There are gates in heaven that cannot be opened except by melody and song.”—Attributed to Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liady, founder of Chabad.

he fact ha Nigguns can be discovered independently in Nigeria seperate from the Jewsish people is truly tesamanen that he secree things belong to God but he things that are revealed are for us and our children forever.

Let the earth be silent before the Lord. Hab 2:20.

As King solomon said everyhing that is happening now has happened before. Ecclestiastis 1:9
