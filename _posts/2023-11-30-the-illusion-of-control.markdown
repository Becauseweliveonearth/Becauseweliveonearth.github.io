If you know everything about someone, can you know how they act is certain situations, can they become deterministic. Can we still say they have free will?

If a person operates based on the conditions they have but for themselves or based on some other conditions determined by upbringing, environment, social media influence, etc.

Is free will the ability to get to the destination, or determine the path.
If you want to loose weight, you cannot eat certain things, is your free will in loosing weight or being able to eat as you like. Because in loosing weight, you have to suspend your free will to eat as you like. Your freewill is in determining your definition of freewill, the age old sin of good and evil. Deciding what is good and evil on your personal scale. So it seems that free will is in choosing your boundaries, drawing the lines, not in the action. Because the action is not free, it costs something. Opportunity Costs economists call it.

There is a Christian verse where Jesus says in me you are free indeed, it seems contradictory when you consider lives christians live that is contrary to pop culture. But this is not considering the boundaries the free will you have chosen has set on you.

For instance, if a child decides to become a pilot rather than a doctor, they are choosing to be a doctor and choosing not to be a pilot. There are actually two choices, free will has two sides to the coin. In the garden of gethsemane, Jesus chose to deny himself and uphold the fathers will. 

In the example of weight loss, you either choose to eat as you like and choose to relinquish your will and accept what your body does with what you eat. Or you choose to deny your will and enforce what you want your body to do.

The illusion of control here is firstly attaching freewill to a purely positive connotation, you are denying something however you choose to slice it. If we do not focus on that. Another illusion of control is that the choices are not binary, they are, you are denying something and accepting something, (while it seems there are 100's of careers, there s the career you picked and the one you did not.) While the overall effect on a system could be weighted, each individual system is binary.(Accumulation of eating decisions rather than habits).

Back to whether humans can be deterministic, do we really have control, if the options for actions have been said to be deterministic, then the differentiating factor is the grounds for decisions and very often each ground for the decision is easily observable, easy traceable and stackable. Even people who have a strong sense of intuition means they have a well interconnected observation of reasons logic/communication tools will fail to explain. 

As I close this out an example is in deciding a career from 100s of careers, usually there is that one or two career you stack against every other one. Oh I just want to make money, I like math and I want to build something, international relations sound fancy, based on my grades I should probably go for this. Very rarely, do the people around us make decisions we do not expect, and when something unexpectedly comes along that s the very definition that it was out of our control all along.

Add: Sometimes we try to make drastic changes, like a career change, a major change, doesn't this signify taking control of our lives, but you are always positioned to make that change. A family loan to start a business, a bored man at the patent office (Einstein), a lab scientist with lots of downtime(Faraday). (A strong conviction). 

There is enough variation in our lives to confound any idea of choice, some people are interested in flying, some rowing.

America has long focused on the binary choice that people have had. It's time to focus on the things we cannot control now, so we see them clearly and fill our lives more with them.

S should we go through life, clicking yes and no buttons mindlessly, the point is you don't click them, they are deterministic, think of the next decision you are going to make. You have made the decision already and waiting for something to change your mind. Whether its the fact that you are going to wait till the last minute to make the decision (that is a decision you have made) or (if-else scenarios). If you are truly conflicted, there is a programming you are fighting. Breathe in, breathe out. The illusion of control is popping up, find a button you can click deterministically and stay in the automated system. Free will is not the action, its the bias for the flesh(exciting) or for the spirit(automated). (free will has nothing to do with strength of will or simple freedoms - at least in this context)

An example is being born in a Nigerian home, there is no illusion of control, there whether the control is from parents or from desires, there is no control. 

It makes it easier to observe the options you are being guided towards.

If its from desires can we say there is control, but we don't have the same desires and until there is a scientific reason why three children born and raised in the same household/environment have

People in the past probably did not try to optimize their lives as much as us today and with good cause, because optimization truly starts when you accept your illusion of control, accept the boundaries, deny everything else. You are not optimizing to be the next einstien, your freewill starts and ends in saying God your will be done
