Lagos runs on a miracle,

Lagos runs on gratitude, 

Lagos runs on hope,

Brad stared, extremely thankful, millions of years of life, thousands of ancestors, tons of wars, tribes and countries, the bus driver that tried to cheat him that day and here he was right in the midst of it.

Lagos runs on energy

16 million people in one city, you never needed an alarm clock,
If the hickens didn't wake you up,
A call to prayer did
The remainants of the carnival did
The cars did,
The school children doing assembly did


Lagos runs on rythm
You don't ignore incidents, you live in community

Lagos runs on everyone
Sleep and wake up as you like

Lagos runs on complex rules

Lagos runs on Landlords

Lagos runs on people

Lagos runs on ??
God

Lagos runs on wild west

Lagos runs on innocence
Discovering who brad wanted to be in Lagos

Lagos runs on pentecost
Fast, fast

Lagos runs
Things you don't understand
