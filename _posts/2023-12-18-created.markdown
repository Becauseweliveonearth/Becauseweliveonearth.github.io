If there is anything, we are all sure we come into the world not knowing much and we all have to be taught. 

We ae taught a strong sense of individuality or moderate, depending on where you grew up. We learn to live in a group, we learn to do things, to contribute.

We learn we are created.....

Sometimes because we come from our parents, it can skip over our heads that that is not the first point of conceptual design. That was simply the process choses to fufill the delivery. There was a designer, a ruler, an artist, colors, tones, shades, logistics, planning, we are created beings.

We have a creator.

Yes its pretty easy to come to the conclusion tha this world has a creator but people seem so complex, so inricate, so delicate, so mulidimensional. All he disciplines would be involved in replicatting an human, even comedy might become a disciple.

So wha do created beings do? What do the toys do at night when the kids go to sleep, maybe we can learn from them. hey go on adventures and make sure they are back before morning ready.

Acknowledge, the iinery comes from God, stay conneced and hae some adventures, don't forget to be back before morning afterall we nly lie on earh once.
