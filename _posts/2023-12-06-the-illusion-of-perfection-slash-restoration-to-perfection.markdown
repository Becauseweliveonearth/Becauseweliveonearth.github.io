In what seemed like the perfect christmas setup, everyone laughing and smiling. Christmas ornaments being sold at the corner, hot chocolate at anther corner, smiles everywhere not a sad face in sight. This most have been why God created human for happy moments like this. For moments of awe on seeing a 15,000 ft christmas tree synced with lights (Okay I exaggerate, and I am allowed to descrie hw I sensed it in a bid to retain the memry).

Yet lurking around the aura of people who seemed like they couldn't have a care in the world was imperfetion.

I once had an argument with a friend about whether perfection could exist. I think as a sciety, there is a current trend of optimizing for perfect moments irregardless of the moments before or after.

Encapsulating perfect moments have become a goal, an objective a way of living. But s many things need to be done in that perfect moment to ensure the next moment is perfect as well.

I was talkng to a young lady considering joining her mother's ifa religion. Such a decision is potentially path changing and yet this was a perfect moment. A perfect mment is truly one that has the momentum to ensure the perfection of futute momemnts. 

And so when God had the plan to restore mankind to perfection, it was to be done moment at a time, the holiday scene looked like perfection but only God could see the hidden cracks, the future tears, the future decisions, the ripple effect.

So as we obtain, celebrate moments of perfection if you believe in perfection (which I do) let us remember that true perfection is only in God. And as we catch glimpses of this restration to perfectin let us remeber until Jesus comes the wrk of perfection will never be perfect( I d nt believe in the perfection of humanity without the return f Jesus..)
