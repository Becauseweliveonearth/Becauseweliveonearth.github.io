I have always been surrounded by water.
The Atlantic
The sounds of rushing water
When it rains, it pours. I didn't know rain was any other way, wasn't rain supposed to "fall"?
The sound of water
I grew up near the coast, something I never thought twice about. 
You would see water flowing in the streets, children bathing outside.
I remember the day borehole was dug at our house, the gush of water
The overflow of the gutters,
The rhythm of the downpour on the aluminium roofs, pita,pita, pita, pata,...pata pa, and again.
The running to get the clothes that could be soaked from the sudden change of weather.
Everywhere was wet, everywhere was rusting.
There was water everywhere.

I looked around, there was no water to be found anywhere. I scoured the nearest body of water was 5 hours away, how coul;d you do that to a human.
The rain stopped for a quick hi, didn't even leave a note.
The thunder barely took a picture.
There was no scent of water.

The water from the tap didn't have the centuries of filtration from the dirt beneath my feet like it was a drink concocted thousands of years just for me.
I use a brita filter.
The waste from plastic bottles too much for me to bear.

Let the land be gathered in one place apart from the waters,
It seems the more we can seperate these two elements, 
Mastery unlocked.
Yet the scent of water.

The water in the air, 
The breeze from the sea in the evening,
Now I live on dry land.
It's the scent of milk and honey;

The soud of water
Never knew any other way, 
wasn't rain supposed to "fall" like the clouds were trying to escape?
The energy, the intensity,
The sound of water
I grew up near the coast, 
The overflow of the gutters,
The sound of moving water calms me
something I never thought twice about. 
Water flowing in the streets, 
Some say broken roads, the water would disagree
children bathing outside.
The sound of water
I remember the day borehole was dug at our house, the gush of water


The running to get the clothes that could be soaked from the sudden change of weather.
Everywhere was wet, everywhere was rusting.
There was water everywhere.

Let the land be gathered in one place apart from the waters,
It seems the more we can separate these two elements, 
Mastery unlocked.

Yet there is something about the scent of water.
The water in the air, 
The breeze from the sea in the evening,
Now I live on dry land.
It's the scent of milk and honey;

I looked around, there was no water to be found anywhere. 
nearest body of water was 5 hours away, 
how could you?
The rains stopped for a quick hi, didn't even leave a note.
