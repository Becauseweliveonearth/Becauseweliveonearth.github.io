Lost the plot was writing my own story
The storyteller came and said this is not the story
How did the storyteller fix the story?
How do you fix a story?
Hey storyteller said the story teller
This is not the story
How do I know the story?
Eons a yonder, remember the story.
I thought stories are told, someone has to tell me.
Eons a yonder, the good news story is told. Otherwise hints will do.
Alright Alright.
What of the gaps in the story
Storyteller said the storyteller
They are yours to fill
No take them storyteller there are no good stories here
They are all yours storyteller
What story do you want to tell? Eternal love, undying perseverance.
I have none of the ingredients for that.
But I'll listen to your stories storyteller 
Hahaha laughed the storyteller
Sit here
A love story should go like this, a dance like this.
See you knew it all.
Here plop and I was dropped into a story
He supplied the eternal, I did the dance.
Haha, this is all comedy
Genres laughed the storyteller
Let's go again laughed the storyteller.
