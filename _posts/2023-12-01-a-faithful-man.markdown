A faithful man who can find?

They say men do the finding maybe because God doesn't want the women to be too discouraged. The wisest man, king solomon attempted to find a faithful man.
"God still has sons," a coined slang by a christian influencer on instagram.

For anyone reading this in the future, i live in a time where there is something called th red pill society. Everything contrrary to the kingdm of God. Like rebels seeking to establish illegitimate kngdoms outside the reign of the true king, eventually the false power fades away.

What makes a faithful man?
How can a young man keep his way pure?
    By guarding it according to your word.
10 With my whole heart I seek you;
    let me not wander from your commandments!
11 I have stored up your word in my heart,
    that I might not sin against you.
12 Blessed are you, O Lord;
    teach me your statutes!
13 With my lips I declare
    all the rules[a] of your mouth.
14 In the way of your testimonies I delight
    as much as in all riches.
15 I will meditate on your precepts
    and fix my eyes on your ways.
16 I will delight in your statutes;
    I will not forget your word.

I once met a nice young man, I laugh fndly when i think of the conversation. He said, he was searching for truth to create his own kingdom. In hindsight, i didn't pay any attention to that, we use the term king and queen so often in this generation. Bt maye its a legitimate desire of men, your only sure provision is nly under he eternal kingdom, the one that will overthrow all other kingdms n the last day, be on the right side.

The son of a king is a king, all yu want is in the bible, you are already a royal priesthood. What you are searching for in the wworld has already been reserved for you. By guardng my heart according to your word.


7A righteous man who walks in his integrityâ€”
How blessed are his sons after him.

A king who sits on the throne of justice
Disperses all evil with his eyes.

11It is by his deeds that a lad distinguishes himself
If his conduct is pure and right.

I will meditate on your precepts
    and fix my eyes on your ways.

What does a faithful man look like, its a man that's there. There is something very unexciting abut faithfulness. t's like wight loss, but the freedm that cmes frm walking on that part, opens up possibilities of life - Jesus (that swirly movement pattern).
